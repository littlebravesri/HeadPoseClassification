# Head Pose Image Classification

Head pose estimation has many applications such as driver monitoring, attention recognition and multi-view facial analysis. This assignment is related to the head pose estimation where the goal is to develop a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to identify the head pose given an image of a person by classifying the images based on the tilt and pan of the head. Given a dataset with images of head in different positions, the objective of building a DCNN is to classify the images into the right tilt and pan positions of the head in that image. Achieving high accuracy (>90%) would be the target by developing a CNN.
